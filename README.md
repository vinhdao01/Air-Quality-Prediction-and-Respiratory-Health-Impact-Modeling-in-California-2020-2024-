# Air Quality Prediction and Respiratory Health Impact Modeling in California (2020–2024)

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes air quality trends across California and models their relationship with respiratory health outcomes. By integrating environmental and public health datasets, we develop predictive models to forecast air quality and assess its impact on asthma-related health outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Forecast future air quality trends using time-series models
* Quantify the impact of air pollution on respiratory health
* Compare statistical and machine learning approaches
* Provide insights for public health and policy decision-making

---

## 📊 Data Sources

* **EPA Air Quality System (AQS)** – Air pollution data
* **California Department of Public Health (CDPH)** – Respiratory health outcomes

**Timeframe:** 2020–2024

---

## 🧪 Modeling Approach

### 🔹 Model 1: AQI Forecast Model

**Goal:** Forecast future population-weighted statewide AQI

* Dataset: `weekly_statewide_aqi.csv`
* Models:

  * ARIMA (baseline time-series model)
  * SARIMA (seasonal model)
  * Random Forest (using time-based features)

**Outputs:**

* AQI forecasts
* Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE)

---

### 🔹 Model 2: Lagged Respiratory Health Impact Model

**Goal:** Predict asthma-related health outcomes based on air pollution exposure

* Dataset: `joint_aqi_health_county.csv`
* Models:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regression
  * Gradient Boosting Regression

**Outputs:**

* Predicted health outcomes
* Model evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)

---

## 📈 Key Results

* **SARIMA** performed best for capturing seasonal AQI trends
* Random Forest captured non-linear relationships but showed limited R² improvement
* Air pollution exposure showed measurable relationships with asthma-related outcomes
